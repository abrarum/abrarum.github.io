    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 17.08.2024</p>
    
    <p>Thank you for choosing to use ReadMyCSV ("the Extension"). This Privacy Policy outlines how your information is handled when you use the Extension. Please read this document carefully to understand our practices regarding your data.</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>ReadMyCSV is a Chrome extension designed to process CSV files into tabular format directly within the user's browser. Your privacy is critically important to us. We aim to make the Extension as privacy-conscious as possible. This Privacy Policy applies only to the Extension and describes how your data is handled by ReadMyCSV.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Personal Data Collection:</strong> The Extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. This includes but is not limited to names, email addresses, or any other identifiable information.</li>
        <li><strong>No Login Required:</strong> There is no requirement for users to create an account or provide any credentials to use the Extension.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Processing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All CSV file processing is conducted locally within your browser. The data contained in the CSV files you upload is not transmitted to any external servers or third parties. This means that no data leaves your device during the use of the Extension.</li>
        <li><strong>No Cloud Storage:</strong> The Extension does not use any cloud services to store your data. Everything stays on your local device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Extension does not integrate with any third-party services that could access your data. It operates independently within your browser environment.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Execution:</strong> Since all operations are performed locally on your device, there is no risk of data interception during transmission because no transmission occurs. The security of your data depends on the security measures you have in place on your own device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. User Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Control Over Data:</strong> Since no data is collected or stored by the Extension, you have full control over your CSV files and the data within them.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> Any data processed using the Extension is not stored by us. As such, there is no data to request deletion of. If you wish to delete any data, you can do so by removing it from your local device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you through the Chrome Web Store or other means. The date of the latest version will be indicated at the top of this policy.</p>
